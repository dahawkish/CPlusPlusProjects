It is a little scary when there is not a dictionary about tree jargons ....

parent node = a node has at least one child
//
root node = it is not usually the top of the tree
leaf node = external node
internal node = must have at least one child ? 
external node = has not children
branch = things that connect children with their parents
spanning tree ...learning
free tree ... something without a BT/BST structure, and you can see the root from any place
binary search tree = you can have one node,, which is fine
binary tree
heap
AVL tree

Parent – The converse notion of child.
Siblings – Nodes with the same parent.
Descendant – a node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.
Ancestor – a node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
Leaf – a node with no children.
Internal node – a node with at least one child.
External node – a node with no children.
Degree – number of sub trees of a node.
Edge – connection between one node to another.
Path – a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
Level – The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.
Height of tree –The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
Height of node –The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.
Depth –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
Forest – A forest is a set of n ≥ 0 disjoint trees.
