It is a little scary when there is not a dictionary about tree jargons ....

parent node = a node has at least one child
//
root node = it is not usually the top of the tree
leave node = internal node
internal node = must have at least one child ? 
external node = has not children
branch = things that connect children with their parents
spanning tree ...learning
free tree ... something without a BT/BST structure, and you can see the root from any place
binary search tree = you can have one node,, which is fine
binary tree
heap
AVL tree
pre-de
suc-ce
