/*

Topological sorting for directed acyclic graph (DAG) IS A LINEAR ORDERING OF VERTICES SUCH THAT FOR EVERY DIRECTED EDGE UV, VERTEX U COMES BEFORE V IN THE ORDERING.
Topological soring for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

DAG =
Acyclic Graph=

Topological Soring vs. Depth Frist Traversal (DFS):
In DFS, we print a vertext and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
In topSort, we need to print a vertect before its adjacent vertice.
