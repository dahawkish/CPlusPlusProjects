What is a minimu spanning tree?
Below are the steps for finding Minimum Spanning Tree ( MST) using Kruskal's algorithm:
1. sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. A>>B>>C>>D>>.....
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree so far. If a cycle is not formed, 
includ this edge. Else, discard it. For edge 1 to edge n, min edge. Chooose a cycle, and include the edge.
3. Repeat step #2 until there are V-1 edges in the spanning tree. V is the number of the vertices in the given graph.

What does Kruskal's algorithm doe?
It is to find the minimum spanning tree of a given connected undirected and weighted graph.
