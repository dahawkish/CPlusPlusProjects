/* 
Sum all the number in a single link. 
You can only use recursion. 
*/

Pseudo code:

I call a list using a function. 
I input a singleList();
I will find each of the element inside the list, and name the element i;
I will use a while loop to find all the elements inside a singleList(i);
While singleList(i) is not null, do
I will check if the singleList only has a tail; else print out the sum
I will use a recursion sum=sum+singleList(i)
I will print out the sum and the singleList.
